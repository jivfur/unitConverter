## 🚀 How to Use

1.  💾 Download the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2.  🖋️ You will need to add your JavaScript logic in a separate file (e.g., `script.js`) and link it in the `index.html`.
3.  🌐 Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4.  ➡️ Select the type of unit you want to convert (e.g., Length).
5.  🔢 Enter the value you want to convert in the "Value to Convert" field.
6.  ⬇️ Choose the initial unit from the "From" dropdown.
7.  ⬆️ Choose the desired unit to convert to from the "To" dropdown.
8.  🔄 Click the "⇆" button to swap the selected units if needed.
9.  ✅ Click the "Convert" button to see the result.
10. The converted value will be displayed in the "Result" section.

## ⚙️ Functionality (To Implement with JavaScript)

Your JavaScript file will need to handle the following:

* Populating the unit options in the "From" and "To" dropdowns based on the selected "Unit Type".
* Adding an event listener to the "Convert" button to perform the unit conversion based on the selected units and the entered value.
* Implementing the logic for the unit conversions themselves.
* Updating the "Result" `div` with the converted value.
* Adding functionality to the "Swap Units" button to exchange the selected units in the dropdowns.

## 🎨 Customization

Feel free to customize the look and feel of the app by modifying the `style.css` file. You can change colors, fonts, layout, and more to match your preferences.
