# 📏 Unit Converter Chrome Extension 📐

A simple and intuitive Chrome extension for converting between various units directly in your browser.

## ✨ Features

* 🔄 Converts between different units of the same type (e.g., length, temperature).
* ⌨️ User-friendly input field to enter the value to convert.
* ⬇️ Two separate dropdown menus for selecting the "from" and "to" units.
* 🔄 A convenient button to swap the selected "from" and "to" units.
* ✅ Clear display of the conversion result.
* 📱 Responsive design that adapts well within the extension context.
* 🎨 Minimalist and modern user interface, designed to feel like a native browser extension.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* 📖 HTML5
* 💧 CSS3
* 💻 JavaScript (for the conversion logic - you've got this!)

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  💾 Download the necessary files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and your `script.js`).
2.  ⚙️ Open your Chrome browser and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  📦 Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4.  📂 Click on "Load unpacked" in the top left corner.
5.  Navigate to the folder where you saved the extension files and select it.
6.  📌 Once installed, you should be able to pin the Unit Converter extension to your Chrome toolbar for easy access.
7.  🖱️ Click the extension icon to open the converter.
8.  ➡️ Select the type of unit you want to convert (e.g., Length).
9.  🔢 Enter the value you want to convert in the "Value to Convert" field.
10. ⬇️ Choose the initial unit from the "From" dropdown.
11. ⬆️ Choose the desired unit to convert to from the "To" dropdown.
12. 🔄 Click the "⇆" button to swap the selected units if needed.
13. ✅ Click the "Convert" button to see the result.
14. The converted value will be displayed in the "Result" section within the extension popup.

## ⚙️ Functionality (To Implement with JavaScript)

Your JavaScript file will need to handle the following:

* Populating the unit options in the "From" and "To" dropdowns based on the selected "Unit Type".
* Adding an event listener to the "Convert" button to perform the unit conversion based on the selected units and the entered value.
* Implementing the logic for the unit conversions themselves.
* Updating the "Result" `div` with the converted value within the extension's context.
* Adding functionality to the "Swap Units" button to exchange the selected units in the dropdowns.

## 🎨 Customization

Feel free to customize the look and feel of the extension by modifying the `style.css` file. Keep in mind the typical size and constraints of a Chrome extension popup.
